This project is a CRUD like that runs on terminal. It was created on my first programming course, a Python course by CursoEmVideo.

### To run this console app follow these 2 steps:
  - move to project directory on your editor terminal -> e.g. ``` cd [DIRECTORY_PATH] ```
  - run this command in your terminal ``` scripts/main.py ```

**Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your device.**
